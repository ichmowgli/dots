Yo! ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains my personal dotfiles for Git, VSCode, Brew, and Zsh. 
I use these dotfiles to set up my dev environment on all my machines, so I can have a consistent setup no matter where I am.

To install my dotfiles, clone this repository to your home directory and run the following command:

```
stow .
```

This will create symbolic links from the dotfiles in this repository to the corresponding files in your home directory.

To update your dotfiles, simply pull the latest changes from this repository and run the `stow` command again.

**Note:** If you are using a different dotfile manager, such as chezmoi or bash-it, please consult the documentation for your dotfile manager on how to install and manage dotfiles.

**Usage**

Once you have installed my dotfiles, you can start using them by opening a terminal or launching VSCode.

The following are some examples of how to use my dotfiles:
